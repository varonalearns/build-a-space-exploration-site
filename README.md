# Build a Space Exploration Site

This is my solution to Build a Space Exploration Site lesson from The Frontend Developer Career Path that can be found on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

## What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned the following:
- Background images
- Webp format
- Google fonts
- The ```<span>``` tag
- IDs and utility classes
- Text-shadow

## Continued Development

To continue to develop this project I did for the lesson, I am thinking adding more features. Maybe making a mock space company web page. As I learn more, I might come back to project to add even more stuff that I have learned.
